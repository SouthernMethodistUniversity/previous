# Why learn coding?

[Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments:Code by Lauren Klein](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/code/) 
“It follows, then, that any instructor—-in the humanities or otherwise-—must first ask herself what she hopes her students will accomplish by learning to code. Is it an understanding of how to think algorithmically, so as to better comprehend how certain tasks can be abstracted into a series of steps? Is it a familiarity with the basic components of programming languages, so as to be able to understand how code is structured and produced? Is it the knowledge of a specialized programming language, one with specific applications in a particular field? Or is it the more experiential knowledge of what it feels like to move from defining functions and assigning variables to running executable code?: [italics added] 

* You don't need to be become fluent if not the focus of your interest, but helpful to have reading fluency, like any other language that is an important part of your research. 

Also like any other language, use will help you retain and gain knowledge. 

***Reoccurring question to keep in mind: What are the affordances of choosing this path? What are the limitations?***
