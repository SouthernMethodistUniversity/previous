# DHRI philosophy 

DHRI emphasizes foundational skills because we believe that it is the most effective path toward enabling digital humanities researchers to become self-teachers and mentors in their own right. Many bootcamp-style intensives prioritize instrumental outcomes, such as whether students can “write a for loop” or create a website. 

While these results are desirable, we find that students who know how to use the command line, read technical documentation, and reason about systems are more self-sufficient and better prepared to approach technology (and technical rhetoric) with a critical eye. This leads to second- and third-order effects as students teach themselves and teach others, and also provides a common conceptual vocabulary and skill set that serves as a basis for forming strong collaborations in the future. 

### DHRI structure 
* "Three structural elements are important for an effective DRI session: scoping, scaffolding, and purpose. Scoping is the art of choosing what—and especially what not—to include in a session. Scaffolding is the process of building later skill development on prior skill development. Purpose provides an answer to the participant who asks, "Why should I care about this?" - [DHRI-Curriculum style guide](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/guide/blob/master/sections/style-guide.md)

### Pedagogical approach
"The DHRI curriculum places great emphasis on foundational technical skills, and roughly one-third of all sessions at the Institute could be described as foundational. ... The difference between an instrumental approach and a foundational approach is often not immediately appreciated by participants, but over time they begin to change their minds. Although an instrumental approach satisfies a researcher’s most immediate need, a foundational approach takes into consideration the long term impact that learning core skills will have for the future professional and research needs of the scholar." [DHRI: Notes toward our pedagogical approach by Lisa Rhody, June 17, 2019](https://www.lisarhody.com/dhri-notes-toward-our-pedagogical-approach/)

### What affordances a foundational approach gives us
* There is a lot that personal computers allow us to take for granted when we do our work; however, knowing fundamentals can help humanities scholars become more confident users and critics of digital technologies. 
* Such knowledge leads not only to becoming a better self-teacher, but to more reflective and informed technology choices. It allows us to save time in creating projects when we know what a well-formed dataset should or could look like, when we know what the difference is between using proprietary software rather than open source, and what kind of support might be needed as projects grow. 

### Why use Communities of Practice (CoP) set up?

1. CoP is the structure of this workshop series 
2. CoP means working together to improve everyone’s learning
3. CoP allows participants to simulate the work done by digital humanists by participating in activities with their fellow attendees


# The pedagogical logic of each workshop session, and how we expect them to build on each other 

* The goal of DHRI is to create a pipeline, so you know what next steps you want to take or what partners you want to seek out. There is a focus on foundational understanding, so you know what questions you want to ask. 

    * What are the fundamental conceptual understandings/frameworks needed for: 
        * Computational thinking? 
        * Humanities thinking? 
        * Computation humanities/digital humanities? 
        * Collaborative work in the Humanities/interdisciplinary work?
    * What does each workshop do? How does the next one build on it?
