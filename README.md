# Welcome and Introduction to DHRI@SMU 

# Background on Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI)


# DHRI philosophy 
DHRI emphasizes foundational skills because we believe that it is the most effective path toward enabling digital humanities researchers to become self-teachers and mentors in their own right. Many bootcamp-style intensives prioritize instrumental outcomes, such as whether students can “write a for loop” or create a website. While these results are desirable, we find that students who know how to use the command line, read technical documentation, and reason about systems are more self-sufficient and better prepared to approach technology (and technical rhetoric) with a critical eye. This leads to second-and third-order effects as students teach themselves and teach others, and also provides a common conceptual vocabulary and skill set that serves as a basis for forming strong collaborations in the future.

# DHRI structure 

* "Three structural elements are important for an effective DRI session: scoping, scaffolding, and purpose. Scoping is the art of choosing what—and especially what not—to include in a session. Scaffolding is the process of building later skill development on prior skill development. Purpose provides an answer to the participant who asks, "Why should I care about this?"
